#
# Given a binary tree, determine if it is a complete binary tree.
#
# Definition of a complete binary tree from Wikipedia:
# In a complete binary tree every level, except possibly the last, is
# completely filled, and all nodes in the last level are as far left as
# possible. It can have between 1 and 2^h nodes inclusive at the last level
# h.
#
#
#
# Example 1:
#
#
#
#
# Input: [1,2,3,4,5,6]
# Output: true
# Explanation: Every level before the last is full (ie. levels with node-values
# {1} and {2, 3}), and all nodes in the last level ({4, 5, 6}) are as far left
# as possible.
#
#
#
# Example 2:
#
#
#
#
# Input: [1,2,3,4,5,null,7]
# Output: false
# Explanation: The node with value 7 isn't as far left as possible.
#
#
#
#
#
# Note:
#
#
# The tree will have between 1 and 100 nodes.
#
#
#
# Definition for a binary tree node.
# class TreeNode:
#     def __init__(self, x):
#         self.val = x
#         self.left = None
#         self.right = None

class Solution:
    def isCompleteTree(self, root: TreeNode) -> bool:
        if not root: return True 
        stack = [root]
        self.empty = False
        
        while stack:
            n = stack.pop(0)
            if not n: self.empty = True 
            if n is None and len(stack) > 0 and stack[-1] is not None: return False 
            if n:
                if self.empty: return False 
                # print(n.val, self.empty)
                stack.append(n.left if n.left else None)
                stack.append(n.right if n.right else None)

        return True
